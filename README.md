react-codesigner is a visual editor for React code.

It allows designers to contribute to React source code through a familiar visual interface.

## Why?

Collaboration between designers and programmers is burdened by use of disparate tools.

Graphics apps excel when used for visual design, but once the product is in production their continued use creates a broken workflow. Every effort to improve a product must be matched with further effort to translate those changes into code. This is costly to both productivity and creativity.

One solution is to teach designers how to code. Knowing how a product is constructed is arguably a vital design skill, but learning to write code may not be necessary to form such mental models. Even setting aside the challenge of retraining as a programmer, writing code is less natural and (in most cases) less efficient than using a graphical interface.

What about existing software solutions? In general, these tend to be either too powerful to be safe to use (e.g. WYSIWYG editors), or not powerful enough to be useful for creative work (e.g. Content Management Systems).

The ideal solution would retain the best features of graphics applications (such as cursor control, immediate visual feedback, and UI controls), whilst safely working on the product's source code. This is what react-codesigner aims to be.
